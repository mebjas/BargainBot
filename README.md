# BargainBot
Assignment - In a AI workshop at Microsoft we were given an assignment to build a basic parser that can understand statements like `Give me two mangos` or `I will give you three bananas`. And use this to do basic Math. I'm taking it further to try and build a bot which can:

  - Understand natural language input, if it matches it's goals.
  - See if the inward bargain is reasonable and in sync with it's own goals.
  - If yes, close the deal, accept changes.
  - If no, propose a different bargain or cut the deal.
  - Send appropriate generated responses.

Main goal is to understand different NLP concepts and try and learn (almost) things from scratch.
